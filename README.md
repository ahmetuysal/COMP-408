# COMP 408

My solutions and reports for the 3 programming assignments for the COMP 408/508 Computer Vision Course of Koç University are listed here. 

## Assignment 1 - Image Filtering and Hybrid Images

Creating [hybrid images](http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/gallery.html) using image filtering with OpenCV.

### Credits
This assignment is based on the project developed by James Hays and Derek Hoiem for a similar computer vision course at Brown University.


## Assignment 2 - Panorama Stitching

Panorama stitching using SIFT descriptors and homography estimation with RANSAC.

### Credits
This assignment is based on the project developed by Fei-Fei Li and Juan Carlos Niebles for a similar computer vision course at Stanford University.


## Assignment 3 - Face Detection With a Sliding Window

Face detection using sliding windows and support vector machines. SVM is trained with HoG features from positive and negative labeled face and non-face images. VLFeat is used for computing HoG features and training SVM.

### Credits
Most of the skeleton code is adapted from a similar assignment in the computer vision course at Brown University by James Hays and Derek Hoiem.

## Notice
Used images in the reports are either given with the started code, taken by me or used with owner's consent.
